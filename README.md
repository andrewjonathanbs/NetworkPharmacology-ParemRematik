Code for "Unveiling Parem Rematik Mechanism of Action in Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis Using Network Pharmacology Approach".
Parem Rematik, a traditional herbal ointment rooted in Karo tradition, has long been utilized for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with empirical efficacy. However, the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic actions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ a network pharmacology approach to investigate and validate the efficacy of Parem Rematik in treating rheumatoid arthritis. First, Parem Rematik material data was collected through a comprehensive literature review. Subsequently, chemical content data of the formulation were acquired from the KnapSack database. Screening of these chemical constituents was performed using Abrahamâ€™s solvation equation to predict skin permeability and drug likeness, followed by comparison with the DrugBank database to identify active molecules within Parem Rematik. Target identification of these active molecules was achieved through interrogation of the Chemical Toxicogenomic Database. Our analysis revealed 40 active chemical compounds within Parem Rematik, correlating with 87 different genes associated with RA according to the Chemical Toxicogenomic Database. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that 12 out of the 87 genes directly correlated with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis with 29 active compounds that affect the genes. These findings suggest that while Parem Rematik comprises numerous active compounds, not all contribute directly to its efficacy in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, optimization of the composition balance may enhance the therapeutic activity of Parem Rematik against rheumatoid arthritis.
